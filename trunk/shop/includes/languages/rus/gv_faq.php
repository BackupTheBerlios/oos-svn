<p>Gift Vouchers are purchased just like any other item in our store. You can 
  pay for them using the stores standard payment method(s).
  Once purchased the value of the Gift Voucher will be added to your own personal 
  Gift Voucher Account. If you have funds in your Gift Voucher Account, you will 
  notice that the amount now shows in he Shopping Cart box, and also provides a 
  link to a page where you can send the Gift Voucher to some one via email.</p>
<br />
<b>How to Send Gift Vouchers.</b><br />
<p>To send a Gift Voucher you need to go to our Send Gift Voucher Page. You can 
  find the link to this page in the Shopping Cart Box in the right hand column of 
  each page.
  When you send a Gift Voucher, you need to sepcify the following.
  The name of the person you are sending the Gift Voucher too.
  The email address of the person you are sending the Gift Voucher too.
  The amount you want to send. (Note you don\'t have to send the full amount that 
  is in your Gift Voucher Account.)
  A short message which will apear in the email.
  Please ensure that you have entered all of the information correctly, although 
  you will be given the opportunity to change this as much as you want before 
  the email is actually sent.</p>
<br />
<b>Buying with Gift Vouchers.</b><br />
  <p>If you have funds in your Gift Voucher Account, you can use those funds to 
  purchase other items in out store. At the checkout stage, an extra box will 
  appear. Ticking this box will apply those funds in your Gift Voucher Account. 
  Please note, you will still have to select another payment method if there 
  is not enough in your Gift Voucher Account to cover the cost of your purchase. 
  If you have more funds in your Gift Voucher Account than the total cost of 
  your purchase the balance will bel left in you Gift Voucher Account for the 
  future.</p>
<br />

  you the Gift Voucher, along with possibly a short message from them. The Email
