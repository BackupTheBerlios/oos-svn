== Description ==

Link Indication adds CSS class attributes to external links and optionally specific attributes to any other link types such as wikipedia.org, flickr, imdb, file extensions like .pdf or .zip, etc. Thereby you can indicate your links, e.g. by images, for characterizing your types of links. Furthermore you can add target="blank" to all external links, rel="nofollow" to specific hyperlinks or display websnapr preview thumbnails.
